# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This landing page was made with CSS3 and HTML5 with a little help of JS. It's fully responsive for all devices, on mobile devices we got hamburger menu with nice transition when opening. I didn't use SASS to this project because it's small landing page so I decided to stay with pure CSS3. I hope you enjoy it because I was having so much fun building it!.
